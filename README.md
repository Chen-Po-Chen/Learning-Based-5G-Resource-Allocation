# Learning-Based 5G Resource Allocation

This is a collection of papers talking about internet resource allcation by machine learning.

According to the [cisco report](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/index.html?CAMPAIGN=MobileVNI2015&COUNTRY_SITE=us&POSITION=PR&REFERRING_SITE=SocialMedia&CREATIVE=PR+to+VNI+page&_ga=1.140386291.1192185982.1416847838#~stickynav=1), the requirement of internet resource is growing rapidly.

(cite: [cisco white paper](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/mobile-white-paper-c11-520862.html))

Thus, a optimal resource allcatino scheme would provde the highest utility in limited resource.

However, resource allocation is a very complex problem.

And we know the machine learning is a very popular way to solve this kinds of problems.

In my research, I want to find a optimal resource allcation policy for the internet by machine learning.
